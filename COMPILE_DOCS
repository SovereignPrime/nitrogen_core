COMPILING THE NITROGEN DOCUMENTATION

(Note: There is *something* up with Ubuntu 14.04's Emacs packages that are
causing problems with compiling the docs. For now, Ubuntu 12.04 is known to
work, and so is recommended for compiling the docs).

Compiling the documentation uses Org-mode for Emacs and a simple Perl script
for adding Disqus comments.

Editing the HTML is not recommended, as the org-mode compiler just overwrites
all HTML anyway. Instead, edit the org-mode files found in doc/org-mode.

Make sure you have emacs installed, with htmlize (version 1.34 or later),
erlang-mode, and org-mode installed.

On Ubuntu, these packages can all be installed with:

sudo apt-get install emacs erlang-mode org-mode emacs-goodies-el


Then you can compile the docs from the command line with

$ make docs


Also worth noting is that the Disqus comment injection script expects perl to
be in the PATH
